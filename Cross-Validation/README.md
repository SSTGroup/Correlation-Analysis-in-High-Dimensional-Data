We consider the problem of estimating of the number of components that are correlated between two sets of high-dimensional data. In many applications the number of available samples is very small, in which case conventional techniques do not accurately determine the model order. Recent approaches for the sample-poor scenario are based on a combined PCA-CCA (principal component analysis-canonical correlation analysis) setup, for which they jointly determine the required model orders for the PCA and CCA steps using either information-theoretic criteria or a sequence of hypothesis tests. In this paper, we propose various alternative approaches based on cross-validation.
