% SYNTAX:
%
% [p,sigma_signals,R] = CorrelationStructureGen(n_sets,tot_corr,...
%   corr_std,signum,sigmad,sigmaf,maxIters)
%
% OVERVIEW: This function generates a correlation structure and
%           augmented covariance matrix for multiple data sets. Correlation
%           coefficients for each signal are randomly selected from a
%           normal distribution with a user prescribed mean and standard
%           deviation. This function enforces the 'transitive correlation 
%           condition.'  This condition is not necessary, but makes 
%           bookkeeping easier.
%
% INPUTS:
%
% 'n_sets'          Scalar.
%                   # of data sets to generate.
%
% 'tot_corr'        Vector of size 1 x # of correlated signals.
%                   Elements are the # of datasets correlated with each
%                   signal.
%
% 'corr_means'      Vector of size 1 x # of correlated signals.
%                   The ith element is the mean of the correlation 
%                   coefficients associated with the ith correlated signal.
%
% 'corr_std'        Vector of size 1 x # of correlated signals.
%                   The ith element is the standard deviation of the
%                   correlation coefficients associated with the ith
%                   correlated signal.
%
% 'signum'          Scalar.
%                   # of correlated + independent signals per set.
%
% 'sigmad'          Scalar.
%                   The variance of the correlated components.
%
% 'sigmaf'          Scalar.
%                   The variance of the idependent components.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
% 'p'               Matrix of size 'n_sets choose two' x signum.
%                   Rows have the same order as x_corrs.  The ith element
%                   of the jth row is the correlation coefficient between
%                   the ith signals in the data sets indicated by the jth
%                   row of x_corrs.
%
% 'sigma_signals'   Matrix of size 'n_sets choose two' x signum.
%                   Rows have the same order as x_corrs.  The ith element
%                   of the jth row is the variance of the ith signals in 
%                   the data sets indicated by the jth row of x_corrs.
%
% 'R'               Matrix of size (n_sets x signum) x (n_sets x signum).
%                   Augmented block correlation matrix of all the data 
%                   sets. Each block is of size signum x signum and the
%                   i-jth block is the correlation matrix between data set
%                   i and data set j.
%
% 'maxIters'        Scalar.
%                   Number of random draws of correlation coefficients
%                   allowed to find a positive definite correlation matrix.
%                   Function throws an error is a PD matrix has not been
%                   found in 'maxIters' attempts.
